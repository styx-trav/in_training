okay, so i can admit when i've been bested

struct lists are still a sore subject for me apparently, so more research is going to be necessary on that front. i need to get:
a. how it works
b. how it's handled
c. why so many pointers ? just - why, i guess
d. test it out a couple times, use it for something or other to find out how i can manipulate it in a more abstract way

alright, tests to get done :
a. create a linked list
b. add a new head (check)
c. add a new tail (check)
d. add a new item using 1)value (check) 2)index (check)
e. delete the head (check)
f. delete the tail (check)
g. delete an item using 1) value (check) 2)index (check)
h. replace the head (check)
i. replace the tail (check)
j. replace an item using 1)value (check) 2)index (check)
k. switch items using index (check)

aaaand we're off !
using this document as a reference and a playing field for functions in the future.
