okay, so i can admit when i've been bested

struct lists are still a sore subject for me apparently, so more research is going to be necessary on that front. i need to get:
a. how it works
b. how it's handled
c. why so many pointers ? just - why, i guess
d. test it out a couple times, use it for something or other to find out how i can manipulate it in a more abstract way
