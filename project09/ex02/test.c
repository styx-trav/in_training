keeping track of tests and progress :

counting the nb of strings : check, works fine now
creating table, protecc : check & tested
checking size of strings (+ filling them) : check not tested
the free protocol :
- use : check
- written : check
alright alright, everythin works as wanted, no leaks
tinkered with to account for the 25 lines rules, etc., but it's hard to know if I'm there or not. Should do fine for now.
