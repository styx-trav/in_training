okay, so.

instructions in short:
./do-op [num1] [operator] [num2]
=> num1 oped by num2

list of operators: +; -; /; *; %.
wrong amount of arguments: nothing.
divide by zero: disp "Stop : division by zero".
modulo by zero: disp "Stop : modulo by zero".
wrong operator: disp "0".
must_do's: use a function pointers tab for different operators.

steps idd so far:
a. atoi for num1 & num2 (check and tested, for ints)
b. create the function pointers tab (check and tested, stack overflow my beloved)
c. reverse atoi for disp (check and tested, for ints)
d. use all (check and tested)
e. optimise and delegate (check and tested)

all good on my end, we'd send back strictly the do-op file imo
